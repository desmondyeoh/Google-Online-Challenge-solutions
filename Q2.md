# Q2 - Problem Statement
Relative sorting is defined as sorting 2 arrays (both in strictly ascending order) such that the only operation allowed is swapping i-th element of one array with the i-th element of the other array.
An array is said to be in strictly ascending order if i-th element of the array is smaller than (i+1)-th element of the array.
You are given 2 arrays of size N. Print the minimum number of swaps required to make both arrays relatively sorted.

## Note
* If the arrays are already relatively sorted, then print `0`.
* If the arrays cannot be relatively sorted, then print `1`.

## Input Format
Input consist of 3 lines.
* First line consist of the size of each array, i.e. N.
* The next 2 lines contain N elements, each seperated by a space.

## Output Format
The output will be an integer i.e., the minimum number of swaps required to make both the arrays relatively sorted.

## Constraints
* 0 < N < 11000
* 0 <= Element in array < 10^9

## Example Input
4
1 4 4 9
2 3 5 10

## Example Output
1

## Example Explanation
Since the first array is not in strictly ascending order, (4 is occuriring twice),swapping 2nd element of the arrays (4 <-> 3) will result in both the arrays being relatively sorted:
* First array: 1 3 4 9
* Second array: 2 4 5 10

## Sample Input
5
2 1 6 5 8
0 3 4 7 9

## Sample Output
2
