# Google-Online-Challenge-solutions
I was invited to participate in Google's Online Challenge (GOC) - Coding (SEA / ML Winter Camp).  

This repository shares the questions and solutions.  
* **[Q1.md](Q1.md) [Q1-solution.py](Q1-solution.py)**
  * Find all delayed projects in a dependency graph.
  * Note: Solution for Q1 was accepted, thus correct.
* **[Q2.md](Q1.md) [Q2-solution.py](Q2-solution.py)**
  * Run relative sorting on 2 arrays.
  * Note: Solution for Q2 was completed after the 45 minute window of the competition, validated with my own extra test cases.
